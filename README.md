# Project Portfolio 3 Python - Hangman Game

Tradicionally hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.
For more details about the origins of this game please click on the below link:

[Hangman - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))

My version of the game allows to play one user at the time, I've implemented a menu that allows players to
chose the word in three different languages, there are a few functions that check the user validation
inputs for the game flow; in this version the player can only guess one letter at the time, if the word content two of the same letters, then they will be displayed on the screen, this increases the chances of winning, if after six attempts the player fails to guess the word, then it's game over.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge acquired throughout the course in Python. 
I hope you all like it and have fun playing.

# Hangaman Flow Chart

A flow chart was created with the main purpose to map the steps to follow throughout the implementation process of this game, I signed up for a free account with [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to be able to produce the below chart.
