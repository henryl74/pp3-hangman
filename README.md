# Portfolio Project 3 Python - Hangman Game

Tradicionally hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

My version of the game allows to play one user at the time, I've implemented a menu that allows player to chose the word in three different languages, there are a few functions that checks the user validation inputs for the game flow; in this version the player can only guess one letter at the time, if the word content two of the same letters, then they will be displayed in the screen, this increases the chances of winning, if after six attemps the player fails to guess the word, then it's game over.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge acquired throughout the course in Python. 
I hope you all like it and have fun playing.
